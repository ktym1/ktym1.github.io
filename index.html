<p4> About Me <br/></p4>

<br/>Four years ago I began my journey to learn how to become technical. I went from code bootcamp, to pair programming with a mentor, to developing a few MVPs. Eventually, I moved into a career that combined my technical knowledge with my client-facing communication skills. On a daily basis, I don't code but I read it, debug it, and communicate about it.<br/></p5> 


<br/><p5>I have spent the last 4 years refining my background of web technologies and web performance. As a technologist, my (non-controversial) belief is understanding machine learning will be a baseline moving forward in the technology industry. As a result, I've enrolled in the University of Toronto's Data Science Certificate to keep my skills stay updated. I'm excited to share thoughts as I move through the program.</p5>
